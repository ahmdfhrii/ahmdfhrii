## 👋 About Me
I am an **Informatics Engineering student** with a strong focus on **DevOps Engineering**, complemented by hands-on experience in **Cyber Security (Web Pentesting)** and **Artificial Intelligence Engineering**.

I specialize in building, automating, securing, and monitoring **cloud-native and production-ready systems**, with a solid understanding of how infrastructure, applications, and security interact in real-world environments.

I am highly interested in **scalable systems, CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code, security testing**, and **AI-powered solutions**.
